# Life Graph - Interactive, data driven personal calendar

### Purpose

Display and visualise a year in the life of you. _With a view to expanding this timeline._

### Core Values / Aims

* Enable the interconnectivity of multiple social media platforms -- Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, Google Photos and more to come.
* Event / day linking -- Spent the day with a group of friends and want to store the memories? Store your memories separately and link them together via an event, post or day!
* Easily create and organise past, present or future events.
* Crystal Clear control over your data, what we do with it, and how we can help protect it.
* Minimal advertising / pay to use system. We do not use your data for targeted advertisments or share with any third parties.
* Here at Life Graph, we firmly believe social media is for organising and remembering social events, not for memes or fake news.
